# Singleton Design Pattern

This source code is part my blog published [here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1190391/Singleton-Design-Pattern-The-Pragmatic-Approach-Pa).

Notes for readers:

You would require the below mentioned software on your machine as prerequisites to run the code (written in C# language) on your computer:

- Visual Studio 2015 or above. I used the community edition which is distributed free from Microsoft.

In case you have any lower version of Visual Studio (VS), then simply create three new projects as per the folder structure that I’ve provided in the attached code. Then, add all the respective files into corresponding projects.
